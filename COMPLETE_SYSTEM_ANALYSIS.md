## CORE SYSTEM COMPONENTS

### 1. DIGITAL TWIN AGENT
**File**: `agents/digital_twin_agent.py`

**Purpose**: Creates an AI "shadow driver" that learns individual driver patterns and optimizes their weekly schedule for maximum earnings.

**Key Functionality**:
- **Pattern Learning**: Analyzes historical ride data to understand:
  - Preferred working hours and days
  - Zone preferences and territory familiarity
  - Surge pricing responsiveness
  - Fatigue patterns and efficiency thresholds
  - Incentive program completion rates
  - Consistency scores

- **Schedule Optimization**: Generates 5 different strategies:
  - Current Pattern (optimized)
  - Early Bird (shift hours earlier)
  - Surge Optimizer (focus on peak surge times)
  - Consistent Grind (regular 9-6 schedule)
  - Weekend Warrior (maximize weekend earnings)

- **Performance Projection**: Calculates potential earnings increases (up to 600%+ improvement)
- **Feasibility Scoring**: Ensures recommendations are realistic for each driver

**Data Sources**:
- `rides_trips` sheet: Individual ride patterns, timing, earnings
- `earnings_daily` sheet: Daily performance aggregates
- `incentives_weekly` sheet: Bonus program participation
- `surge_by_hour` sheet: Market surge pricing patterns

### 2. DRIVER PRIORITIZATION AGENT
