# Driver Digital Twin Agent - Implementation Guide

## What is the Digital Twin?

The **Driver Digital Twin** is an AI "shadow driver" that learns from a driver's historical patterns and simulates optimal weekly schedules to maximize earnings. It's like having a personal data scientist for each driver!

##  What it Learns

The AI analyzes multiple data sources to understand each driver's unique behavior:

### **Behavioral Patterns**
- **Preferred Hours**: When they usually drive (e.g., 6AM-10AM, 5PM-9PM)
- **Peak Days**: Their most active days (e.g., Friday, Saturday, Sunday)
- **Zone Preferences**: Which areas they prefer to work in
- **Consistency Score**: How regular their patterns are (0-1 scale)

### **Economic Patterns** 
- **Earnings per Hour**: Average income rate by time period
- **Surge Responsiveness**: How they react to surge pricing (-1 to +1)
- **Fatigue Threshold**: When efficiency starts dropping (hours worked)
- **Incentive Completion Rate**: How often they complete bonus programs

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Current Performance**: Baseline weekly earnings, hours, rides
- **Optimization Potential**: Projected improvements from schedule changes
- **Feasibility Scores**: How realistic each recommendation is

## Implementation Features

### Core Components

1. **`DigitalTwinAgent`** - Main AI engine
   - Learns patterns from historical data
   - Generates optimization scenarios
   - Calculates feasibility scores

2. **`DriverProfile`** - Behavioral model
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class DriverProfile:
       driver_id: str
       preferred_hours: List[int]
       peak_days: List[str]
       avg_earnings_per_hour: float
       surge_responsiveness: float
       fatigue_threshold: int
       preferred_zones: List[int]
       incentive_completion_rate: float
       consistency_score: float
   ```

3. **Optimization Scenarios** - Different strategies:
   - **Current Pattern**: Their existing behavior optimized
   - **Early Bird**: Shift hours earlier to avoid competition
   - **Surge Optimizer**: Focus on high-surge periods (evenings/weekends)
   - **Consistent Grind**: Regular 9-6 schedule across weekdays  
   - **Weekend Warrior**: Maximize weekend earnings

## How to Use

### Basic Usage
```python
from agents.digital_twin_agent import DigitalTwinAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = DigitalTwinAgent()

# Learn a driver's patterns
profile = agent.learn_driver_patterns('E10156')

# Generate optimization recommendations
optimization = agent.simulate_optimal_week(profile)

# Display results
agent.visualize_driver_profile(profile)
agent.print_optimization_results(optimization)
```

### Integrated Usage
```python
from agents.rides_analysis_agent import create_digital_twin

# One-line analysis with visualization
profile, optimization = create_digital_twin('E10156')
```

### Interactive Demo
```bash
python demo_digital_twin.py
```

## Demo Results Example

For driver E10156 (most active driver):

```
üìä CURRENT PERFORMANCE:
   Weekly Earnings: ‚Ç¨74.11
   Weekly Hours: 3.3h
   Weekly Rides: 8

‚≠ê BEST RECOMMENDATION: surge_optimizer
   Projected Earnings: ‚Ç¨572.02
   Improvement: +671.9% (+‚Ç¨497.91/week)
   Feasibility: 64.8%
   
üí° STRATEGY: Focus on weekend evenings (Fri/Sat 5PM-11PM)
üöÄ This could significantly boost earnings!
```

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources Used
- **`rides_trips`**: Individual ride patterns, timing, earnings
- **`earnings_daily`**: Daily performance aggregates  
- **`incentives_weekly`**: Bonus program participation
- **`surge_by_hour`**: Market surge pricing patterns

### AI Techniques
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Statistical analysis of time series data
2. **Behavioral Modeling**: Correlation analysis for preferences
3. **Optimization Simulation**: Monte Carlo-style scenario testing
4. **Feasibility Scoring**: Multi-factor compatibility assessment

### Key Algorithms
- **Surge Responsiveness**: `corr(ride_activity, surge_multiplier)`
- **Fatigue Threshold**: Point where `working_hours` negatively correlates with `efficiency`
- **Consistency Score**: `1 / (1 + start_time_std + ride_count_cv)`
- **Earnings Projection**: `base_earnings √ó surge_bonus √ó fatigue_penalty √ó day_bonus`

## Visualizations Generated

1. **Preferred Hours Bar Chart** - When they like to drive
2. **Peak Days Activity** - Which days they're most active  
3. **Performance Radar Chart** - Multi-dimensional driver profile
4. **Hourly Earnings Pattern** - Income variation by time
5. **Weekly Distribution** - Ride frequency across days
6. **Key Stats Summary** - Performance metrics overview
