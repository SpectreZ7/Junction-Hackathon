## Data Sources & Mock Data

### **Uber Mock Dataset** (`uber_mock_data.xlsx`)
Comprehensive simulation of real driver data across multiple sheets:

- **`rides_trips`**: Individual ride records with timing, earnings, zones
- **`earnings_daily`**: Daily performance aggregates per driver  
- **`incentives_weekly`**: Bonus program participation and completion
- **`surge_by_hour`**: Market surge pricing patterns by time/location

### **Wellbeing Survey Data** (`wellbeing_survey.csv`)
Health monitoring data for 50+ drivers including:
- Sleep hours (last 24h)
- Fatigue level (1-5 scale)
- Stress level (1-5 scale) 
- Body discomfort (1-5 scale)
- Mood rating (1-5 scale)
- Timestamp for trend analysis

### **Sample Driver Profiles**
